Who We Are

The owners partnered in 2012 with a vision to protect the environment in a way that is rooted in the fundamentals of recycling, but with an innovative approach to improving the lives of others along the way.

We hold community fundraisers and donate the proceeds to various organizations to benefit community projects, less-fortunate families, individuals with serious illness, and disaster relief.

The company also has begun looking at ways to improve both the process and the outcome of electronics recycling---researching ways to turn plastic waste into affordable filament for 3D printers; and exploring more efficient and cutting-edge machines to process hazardous materials from waste---such as CRT monitors and Tube Televisions.

Adonis Electronics Recycling realizes that the e-waste epidemic is more than we can do alone. We are reaching out into to the community to partner with consumers and companies that are on the front lines of e-waste. These partnerships allow us to meet this challenge head on and help us to make the greatest possible impact.

With the support of the local businesses, corporations, not-for-profit organizations, schools, government agencies, and the individuals in the community, we can make a significant difference for the environment and each other.
