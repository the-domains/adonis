# Our Mission

Our mission here at Adonis is to divert unnecessary electronic waste from landfills by collecting, disassembling,  and redistributing electronics responsibly. We can accomplish this with the help of  businesses, charities, fund raisers, schools, and individuals who are willing to help lead the charge against irresponsible discarding. By partnering with diligent advocates we can accomplish our goal to divert e-waste, and simultaneously raise money for our partners interest.  We understand here at Adonis that there is a lot that can be done to promote a cleaner and healthier society and have the ability and know how to facilitate our goals and the goals of others we accomplish this by being part of a community, pioneering a new path to raise funds for the interest of others, and simply making it easier and beneficial to recycle. We believe we can make a difference.
